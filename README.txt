Code written in python 3 using jupyter notebook

The S2 data files are large for uploading here. Sample images are included here.
Six sample data files are included here. Three original and three manually labeled. Autolabeled and shadow filtered images can be optained by using the color segmentation method and the thin cloud shadow filter method respectively.

Due to file size constrain, the U-net model files also not present.

1. Color segmentation is in the "S2_Satellite_Color_Segementation.ipynb" file
2. Cloud Filtering is in the "Cloud_Shadow_Filtering.ipynb" file
3. The U-Net-Man and U-Net-Auto code is included here separately in two files.
